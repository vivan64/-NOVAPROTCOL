NovaProtocol â€” Audit Summary

Scope
- Code reviewed: contract stubs in /contracts
- Testnets used: NONE
- Focus areas: contract design, cross-chain routing logic, gas estimations 

Findings 
- Issue #1 (low): Placeholder variable naming inconsistent in DemoContract.sol.
- Issue #2 (informational): Demo bridging logic is conceptual; real implementation would require hardened validators and bridge verification.

Recommendations
- For production: independent audit by a recognized security firm; enforce time locks and multi-sig for custody; deploy on testnet with audit tracking.
